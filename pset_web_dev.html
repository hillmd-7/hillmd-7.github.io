       <p>
           I attempted to improve my understanding of the experiences <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a> users
           can have by diving into some reported experiences on <a href = "https://www.erowid.org/splash.php">Erowid</a>. From the experiences 
           I read, I started to find some commonalities among reports. While these are still likely oversimplifications, 
           I did make a few observations.
        </p>   
        <image src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Cocaine3.jpg" width="166" height="228"></img>
       <p>
            Cocaine use seems to come with a mixed bag of experiences. Many people report feeling an intense euphoria for several minutes after ingestion. For some people, that seems to be an extremely enjoyable experience, while for others, it seems to be somewhat underwhelming. Similarly, cocaine seems to be more addictive for some people than others. For many, at least some level of craving can come almost immediately.
           Different methods of ingestion and doses also seem to have different effects on users. Intravenous use seems to have particular potential for causing distress for the user, as do high doses taken with any method of ingestion.  
        </p>
       <p>
           After spending some time on Erowid, I visited <a href = "https://calib.ro/pronoia/">Visualizing Erowid</a> and looked at the way in which the site has conglomerated data from user experiences. I reflected on the differences between reading individual user reports and looking at data trends.
        </p>
       <p>
           Each experience reported on Erowid is personal; people get to tell their own stories. As a reader, I got to get into the writers’ heads and gain insight into their feelings every step of the way. I got to learn how they felt before, during, and after the highs associated with cocaine use. I got to experience tidbits of their personalities as they detailed what they did on a given day besides using cocaine. People reporting their experiences on Erowid have the opportunity to tell their stories exactly how they would like, and for a lot of users, that becomes quite literary and creative. These personal accounts put a personal spin on drug use and allow readers to reach a sense of understanding beyond what a chart showing conglomerated data might tell us. They remind us that substance use is different for every person. 
        </p>
       <p>
            However, looking at data in a conglomerate also provided some helpful insights. First, it made apparent the male-dominated nature of reports, even though among substances discussed on Erowid, cocaine use reports are one of the less male-dominated sets. Looking at data on Visualizing Erowid also provides insight into the wide age range in the cocaine use reports. 
        <p>
            Visualizing Erowid also makes apparent which commonalities are “most common” among reports. Something I would not have predicted is that “crystal meth” was one of the top word pairs among cocaine use reports. It hardly popped up in the reports I read, but I was able to know that it was a common word pair within seconds of looking at Visualizing Erowid.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is one of many ways in which data is powerful. Some observations would only come if I read every single user report in detail. Other observations still wouldn’t come because I wouldn’t be able to be fully objective. Data allows the viewer to take a step back and look at larger trends. It can provide a starting point for understanding the diversity of experiences that exists. Effective use of data, combined with attention to personal experiences, can contribute to a cohesive understanding of the experiences people have.
